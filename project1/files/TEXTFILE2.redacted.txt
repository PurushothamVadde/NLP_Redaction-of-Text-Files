All the way back to the █, I sought to soothe him, but█was a█possessed.█rushed up the ship's gangway, burst into central quarters and drew up before █ like a runner stopping at the tape.

"You damned lying hypocrite!"█yelled.

█ looked at█in█quiet way. "Take it easy, █,"█said. "Sit down and explain yourself."

But █ didn't sit down.█thrust█hand in█pocket, pulled out the piece of black stone█had chipped off the image in the cavern and handed it to █.

"Take a look at that!"█demanded.

█ took the stone, glanced at it and laid it down on█desk.█face was emotionless. "I expected this sooner or later,"█said. █ Is that what you want me to say?"

There was a dangerous fanatical glint in █'s eyes now. With a sudden quick motion█pulled out█heat pistol.

"So you tricked us!"█snarled. "Why? I want to know why."

I stepped forward and seized █'s gun hand. "Don't be a fool," I said. "It can't be that important."

█ threw back█head and burst into an hysterical peal of laughter. "Important!"█cried. "Tell█how important it is, █. Tell him."

Quietly the Navigator filled and lighted█pipe. █ "I did trick you. Not purposely, however. And in the beginning I had no intention of telling anything but the truth. Actually we're here because of a dead man's vengeance."

█ took█pipe from█lips and stared at it absently.

"You'll remember that Ganeth-█, the Martian, and I worked together to invent Indurate. But whereas I was interested in the commercial aspects of that product, █ was absorbed only in the experimental angle of it.█had some crazy idea that it should not be given to the general public at once, but rather should be allocated for the first few years to a select group of scientific organizations. You see, Indurate was such a departure from all known materials that Ganeth-█ feared it would be utilized for military purposes.

"I took█for a dreamer and a fool. Actually█was neither. █ was I to know that█keen penetrating brain had seen through my motive to get control of all commercial marketing of Indurate? █ █ must have been aware of my innermost thoughts, but Martian-like█said nothing."

█ paused to wet█lips and lean against the desk. "I didn't kill Ganeth-█,"█continued, "though I suppose in a court of law I would be judged responsible for█death. The manufacture of Indurate required some ticklish work. As you know, we produced our halves of the formula separately. Physical contact with my half over a long period of time would prove fatal, I knew, and I simply neglected to so inform Ganeth-█.

"But█ultimate death was a boomerang. With █ gone, I could find no trace of█half of the formula. I was almost beside myself for a time. Then I thought of something. █ had once said that the secret of█half of the formula lay in himself. A vague statement, to say the least. But I took the words at their face value and gambled that█meant them literally; that is, that█body itself contained the formula.

"I tried everything: X-ray, chemical analysis of the skin. I even removed the cranial cap and examined the brain microscopically. All without result. Meanwhile the police were beginning to direct their suspicions toward me in the matter of █'s disappearance.

"You know the rest. It was necessary that I leave █ at once and go beyond our system, beyond the jurisdiction of the planetary police. So I arranged this voyage with a sufficient complement of passengers to lessen the danger and hardship of a new life on a new world. I was still positive, however, that █'s secret lay in█dead body. I took that body along, encased in the Martian preservative, solidifex.

█

"What do you mean?" I said slowly.

"I said █ was no fool. But I didn't know that with Martian stoicism█suspected the worst and took█own ironic means of combating it.█used the last lot of Indurate to make that booster, a device which█said would increase our take-off speed.█mounted it on the █.

"█, that device was no booster. It was a time machine, so devised as to catapult the ship not into outer space, but into the space-time continuum. It was a mechanism designed to throw the █ forward into the future."

█ "What do you mean?" I said again.

█ paced around█desk. "I mean that the █ has not once left █, has not in fact left the spot of its moorings but has merely gone forward in time. I mean that the nine 'landings' we made were not stops on some other planets but halting stages of a journey into the future."

Had a bombshell burst over my head the effect could have been no greater. Cold perspiration began to ooze out on my forehead. In a flash I saw the significance of the entire situation. That was why █ had been so insistent that we always return to the ship before dark.█didn't want us to see the night sky and the constellations there for fear we would guess the truth. That was why█had never permitted any of us in the bridge cuddy and why█had kept all ports and observation shields closed.

"But the names of the planets ... Coulora, █, and the others and their positions on the chart...?" I objected.

█ smiled grimly. "All words created out of my imagination. Like the rest of you, I knew nothing of the true action of the booster. It was only gradually that truth dawned on me. But by the time we had made our first 'landing' I had guessed. That was why I demanded we always take organic surveyor readings. I knew we had traveled far into future time, far beyond the life period of█on █. But I wasn't sure how far we had gone, and I lived with the hope that █'s booster might reverse itself and start carrying us backwards down the centuries."

For a long time I stood there in silence, a thousand mad speculations racing through my mind.

"█ about that piece of Indurate?" I said at length. "It was chipped off an image in the ruins of a great building a mile or so from here."

"An image?" repeated █. A faint glow of interest slowly rose in█eyes. Then it died. "I don't know,"█said. "It would seem to presuppose that the formula, both parts of it, was known by █ and that█left it for posterity to discover."

All this time █ had been standing there, eyes smouldering, lips an ugly line. Now abruptly█took a step forward.

"I've wanted to return this for a long time,"█said.

He doubled back█arm and brought█fist smashing onto █' jaw. The Navigator's head snapped backward;█gave a low groan and slumped to the floor.

And that is where, by all logic, this tale should end. But, as you may have guessed, there is an anticlimaxâ€”what story-tellers call a happy conclusion.

█, █, and I worked, and worked alone, on the theory that the secret of the Indurate formula would be the answer to our return down the time trail. We removed the body of Ganeth-█ from its solidifex envelope and treated it with every chemical process we knew. By sheer luck the fortieth trial worked. A paste of carbo-genethon mixed with the crushed seeds of the Martian iron-flower was spread over █'s chest and abdomen.

And there, in easily decipherable code, was not only the formula, but the working principles of the ship's boosterâ€”or rather, time-catapult. After that, it was a simple matter to reverse the principle and throw us backward in the time stream.

We are heading back as I write these lines. If they reach print and you read them, it will mean our escape was successful and that we returned to our proper slot in the epilogue of human events.

There remains, however, one matter to trouble me. █. I like the man. I like█tremendously, in spite of█cold-blooded confession, and past record.█must be punished, of course. But I, for one, would hate to see█given the death penalty. █
